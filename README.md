## Messenger using sockets

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

A messenger using this principle was implemented on C. We have used local host (127.0.0.1) for server, so that we can check using 2 terminals.
Please correct me, if there are any flaws.. :)
